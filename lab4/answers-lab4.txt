Q1: Compare kern/mpentry.S side by side with boot/boot.S. Bearing in mind that kern/mpentry.S is compiled and linked to run above KERNBASE just like everything else in the kernel, what is the purpose of macro MPBOOTPHYS? Why is it necessary in kern/mpentry.S but not in boot/boot.S? In other words, what could go wrong if it were omitted in kern/mpentry.S?
A1: kern/mpentry.S was compiled and linked to run above KERNBASE, but APs start in real mode, which means it can only address below 1MB. So in order to execute mpentry code, we need to move it to MPENTRY_PADDR(0x7000). The purpose of macro MPBOOTPHYS is to translate the address generated by linker (link address) to the actual physical address (load address). If we omitted it, the address we get is link address which above KERNBASE. And while APs is running under real mode, it can't access these address correctly which will cause things to fail.
