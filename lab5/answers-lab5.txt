Q1. Do you have to do anything else to ensure that this I/O privilege setting is saved and restored properly when you subsequently switch from one environment to another? Why? 
A1. No, because the I/O privilege setting is part of the EFLAGS register (bit12 and bit13) and it is saved seperately for each enviroment. Everytime we switch from one enviroment to another enviroment, the EFLAGS register will be reloaded. So when we switch from I/O privilege enviroment to non-I/O privilege enviroment, the EFLAGS register will not be the same and so the I/O privilege setting will not be the same too.
